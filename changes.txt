Documentation of changes compared to the czech prestudy:
- adding "noninteractive" to the explanation of terms
- changing the explanation of "language use", more short, more clear (students decided between two versions: 1st was the exact translation of the czeck text, 2nd was an adapted version)

- other minor changes in the list of the terms description
- color impelmentation (blue) to draw the attention of the participants to certain terms
- alignment of the scale titels within the itmes, same structure for each scale, e.g.
Является ли использование языка в описанной ситуации скорее субъективным или объективным?
- added questions about age and gender
